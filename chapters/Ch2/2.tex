% In this study, a high dimensional scenario is considered where the number of predictors $(p)$ is large but less than the number of observations $(n)$ i.e. $p<n$. This setup allows us to use OLS as a benchmark to be able to make comparisions with sparsity-based estimators. \\

% Consider:
% $ n $ = total number of observations,
% $ p $ = number of control variables,
% $ D $ = treatment variable 

To replicate and extend the findings from the original paper "The Fragility of Sparsity", we followed the following steps as our methodology. We tested how robust sparsity-based estimates (SBEs) like the lasso are in different situations with different models. We followed the original paper's methodology and added steps to explore how its findings apply more in different empirical scenarios and contexts.
