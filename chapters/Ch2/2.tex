In this study, a high dimensional scenario is considered where the number of predictors $(p)$ is large but less than the number of observations $(n)$ i.e. $p<n$. This setup allows us to use OLS as a benchmark to be able to make comparisions with sparsity-based estimators. \\

Consider:
$ n $ = total number of observations,
$ p $ = number of control variables,
$ D $ = treatment variable
