\begin{enumerate}
    \item Empirical Applications: The study begins with selecting empirical applications that are relevant for testing the robustness and validity of sparsity based estimators.
    \item Choice of p: Based on the number of observations, choose the number of predictors in the model, ensuring that p is less than n to be able to use the OLS benchmark.
    \item Normalizations: Apply different normalization methods to check for the robustness of the statistics
    \item Analysis / Tests: Apply the Hausmann test and Residual test to evaluate the sensitivity of SBEs for different normalizations.
\end{enumerate}
