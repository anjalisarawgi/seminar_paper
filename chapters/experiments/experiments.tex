The goal of my experiments is to test the findings from the original paper ``The Fragility of Sparsity", in a different context. I focus on evaluating the robustness of sparsity-based estimators (SBEs) against Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression across different dimensions, also considering the case for $p>n$. For our analysis, we use two different datasets: \textbf{Communities and Crime Dataset} available from the UCI repository (\cite{misc_communities_and_crime_unnormalized_211}) and \textbf{Lalonde dataset} from the doWhy package (\cite{dowhy} and \cite{JMLR:v25:22-1258}). Additionally, I also aim  to evaluate if similar concerns about the validity of sparsity assumptions arise in machine learning contexts, as they do in social science applications.
