The goal of my experiments is to test the findings from the original paper "The Fragility of Sparsity". I focused on evaluating the robustness of sparsity based estimators (SBEs) against Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using two different datasets: \textbf{Communities and Crime Dataset} available from the UCI repository (\cite{misc_communities_and_crime_unnormalized_211}) and \textbf{Lalonde dataset} from the doWhy package (\cite{dowhy} and \cite{JMLR:v25:22-1258}).\\

We utilized these two datasets to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the sparsity
assumption under different empirical conditions. The Lalonde dataset is a well-
known benchmark in causal inference offering a stable environment to validate the
results of our experiments. In contrast, the Communities and Crime Dataset
presents a high-dimensional data scenario with larger number of observations. This
allows us to examine the performance of SBEs under various conditions, including
different subsets of the data for further exploration and splitting the data to compute the mean squared error (MSE) under multiple settings.\\
