The goal of my experiments is to test the findings from the original paper "The Fragility of Sparsity". I focused on evaluating the robustness of sparsity based estimators (SBEs) against Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression using two different datasets: \textbf{Communities and Crime Dataset} available from the UCI repository (\cite{misc_communities_and_crime_unnormalized_211}) and \textbf{Lalonde dataset} from the doWhy package (\cite{dowhy} and \cite{JMLR:v25:22-1258}).
