\textbf{Testing for varying number of observations $n$:}\\
To further examine the effect of varying sample sizes on the fragility of SBEs, we performed experiments using three different sample sizes from the \textbf{Communities and Crime dataset:} the full dataset, a subset of 500 observations, and a subset of 150 observations. This enables us to evaluate whether the results where consistent across different sample sizes and provided insignts into the robustness of SBEs for varying dataset sizes.
