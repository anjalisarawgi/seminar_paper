\textbf{Hausman Test}\\
To test the robustness of SBEs across different dimensions, we applied various feature transformations to the dataset.  These transformations were done to increase the dimensions of the data. The  transformations included taking polynomial features, interactions, statistical transformations (log and square roots) and noise additions. Specifically, we experimented with three cases: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Original Case: with original number of predictors $(p)$ where $p$ is much smaller than the number of observations $n$
    \item $p$ close to $n$ case: where number of predictors $p$ is close to the number of observations $n$
    \item $p$ is more than $n$ case: where the number of predictors $p$ exceeds the number of observations $n$
\end{enumerate}
This approach helps us assess the fragility of sparsity assumption in settings with varying levels of complexity and dimensionality.
