\textbf{Hausman Test}\\
The Hausman test assumes that the sparsity-based estimator (SBE) is more efficient than Ordinary Least Squares Estimator. However, if the variance difference [$var(\beta_\text{OLS}) -  var(\beta_\text{SBE})$] is negative, then it suggests that the assumption of the test might not hold, thereby making the test invalid. A negative value implies that SBE is less efficient than OLS, which contradicts the main basis of the test.
