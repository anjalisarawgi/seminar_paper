\textbf{Preprocessing Variations:}\\
These experiments evaluate the impact of preprocessing on the robustness of SBEs by conducting experiments with datasets that were both preprocessed with outlier and multicollinearity checks and without any of these checks. This helped us determine how preprocessing choices for a cleaner dataset could affect the validity of the stability of sparsity-based estimators.
