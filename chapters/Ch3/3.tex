In regression analysis, normalizations refers to the transformations applied to the variables before they are used in models. In this case of estimating causal effects, these normalizations referes to the transformations of the control variables. In such cases, we define a control matrix $W_i$ which consists of all our control variables. However, the paper discusses how setting up this control matrix, essentially changes results for the coefficients of estimates in general.
